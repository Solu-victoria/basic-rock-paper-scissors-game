# Rock Paper Scissors game (Random edition)
Welcome to the **Rock Paper Scissors Game**! ðŸŽ®  
This is a simple Python game where you can test your luck and strategy against the computer's **very random** moves.  

### How to Play:

1. **Run the Code**:
   - Save the script as a `.py` file (e.g., `rockpaperscissors.py`).
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the folder where the file is saved.
   - Run the script using the command:
     ```bash
     python rockpaperscissors.py
     ```

2. **Follow the Prompts**:
   - Enter your move: `"rock"`, `"paper"`, `"scissors"`, or `"quit"` to exit the game.
   - The computer will randomly select its move, and the game will display the result of each round.

3. **View the Results**:
   - The terminal will display the outcome of each round (win, lose, or tie) and the current scoreboard.

Enjoy the game! ðŸ˜Š
